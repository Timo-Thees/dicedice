What is DiceDice?

DiceDice is a little app designed to help me with TTRPGs (TableTop RolePlayingGames. You know, the Dungeons and Dragons stuff).
I wanted an application that reminds me of the rules/consequences of a roll and can be shared via discord/whatever so everyone can se the results (and noone thinks they are beeing cheated)

What is in the App right now?

Curently I have 3 systems implemented. Duneon World and monster of the Week bioth use the Powerd by the Apocolypse system. Here the main goal is to have the rules and consequences for a roll readily available.
The fate system is interesting and more complex. Here my main reason was that I didnt want to spring 20â‚¬ for a set of dice.

But there are tons of apps that already can do what you are doing.

I just want to code, dude

Why not use a simple Number Generator?

I did that in the past and it feels very different. Between declaring a roll and getting the results to see if you sucseded there is a moment of anticipation
